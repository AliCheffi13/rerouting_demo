# XGBoost Prediction 

## Overview
Web-based demo created during a hackathon to test an ML powered most efficient rerouting predictions 
The goal was rapid prototyping rather than perfect generalization.

## Tech Stack
- XGBoost
- Python/Jupyter notebooks 
- Streamlit 

## Inner-working
 the model uses data from sensors (Temperture,humidity,oxygen_ppm...) embedded in an oil transporting vehicle combined with data about itinerary(road quality, elevation..) 
 to provide the most cost efficient transporting route for the vehicle driver to follow  

## Limitations
- overfitting observed due to the synthethic nature of the data used for the training due to the lack of exploitable data and the time constraint related to the hackathon 
- not intended for production use
